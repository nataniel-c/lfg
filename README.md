# LFG

Looking For Gamers, or LFG for short, is a platform where gamers can look for others to play games with. With the ability to sort between which types of games, a player can find people that fit their criteria. If you find someone you want to have in your group, or just a partner, you can TeamUp with them!

To TeamUp with other gamers, you would need to create a profile which you can include different games or game genres that you like. Other things you might put in your profile might be your name (optional), your gamertag, and your age group. All of these things can be edited and changed via the profile page.
